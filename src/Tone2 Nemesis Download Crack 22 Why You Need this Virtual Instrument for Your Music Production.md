> "Powerful, flexible and different, Nemesis is a synth that any producer of high-impact electronic music will be blown away by."<cite><a href="https://www.musicradar.com/reviews/tech/tone2-nemesis-596711">MusicRadar</a></cite>

> "Nemesis features the traditional FM type synthesis but also adds their own spin with what they call âNeoFM Synthesis.â Iâve had experience with Tone2 and figured if anyone can make this easy, it will be these guys. I was not let down."<cite><a href="https://everythingrecording.com/review-tone2-nemesis/">Everything Recording</a></cite>

> "Tone2 made sure to take just as much care in designing Nemesis as they did with Rayblaster. Nemesis takes the best aspects of both types of FM synthesis (phase modulation and âreal analog FMâ) and combines them, booting out the negative effects of conventional FM methods."<cite><a href="https://sonicscoop.com/review-nemesis-neofm-synthesis-virtual-instrument-from-tone2/">SonicScoop</a></cite>
