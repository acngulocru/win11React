In this article, we will show you how to use CloneDVD 2 to copy DVDs in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download and install CloneDVD 2
 
You can download CloneDVD 2 from the official website of RedFox[^1^] or Elaborate Bytes[^2^], the developers of the software. You can also find it on other websites such as Filehippo[^3^], but make sure you download it from a trusted source. After downloading the setup file, run it and follow the instructions to install CloneDVD 2 on your computer. You will need a Windows compatible PC with minimum 2 GHz Processor and 1 GB RAM, a DVD reader and preferably a DVD writer, and about 5 GB of temporary available hard-drive space.
 
## Step 2: Insert the DVD you want to copy
 
Insert the DVD you want to copy into your DVD drive and wait for it to be recognized by your computer. If the DVD is encrypted or protected by any copy protection mechanism, you will also need a software like AnyDVD or AnyDVD HD to decrypt it and remove the protection. You can download AnyDVD from the same websites as CloneDVD 2.
 
## Step 3: Launch CloneDVD 2 and select the source
 
Launch CloneDVD 2 and click on the first button on the left, which says "Clone DVD". This will open a window where you can select the source of your DVD copy. You can choose to copy from a DVD reader, an ISO image file, or a folder on your hard drive. In this case, we will select the DVD reader option and choose our DVD drive from the drop-down menu. Click on "Next" to proceed.
 
## Step 4: Select the output method and target
 
In this window, you can select how you want to output your DVD copy. You can choose to write it to a DVD writer, create an ISO image file, or create a folder on your hard drive. In this case, we will select the DVD writer option and choose our DVD burner from the drop-down menu. You can also select the writing speed and whether you want to verify the data after writing. Click on "Next" to proceed.
 
## Step 5: Select the titles and audio tracks
 
In this window, you can select which titles and audio tracks you want to include in your DVD copy. You can see a preview of all the selectable DVD titles on the left side, and a filmstrip assistant that guides you through all the available configuration settings on the right side. You can use the sliders to adjust the target size and quality of your DVD copy, and use the checkboxes to include or exclude the original menu, subtitles, bonus material, etc. You can also trim or split individual chapters by clicking on them on the filmstrip. A visual quality bar shows how your configuration choices affect the quality of the final copy. Click on "Next" to proceed.
 
## Step 6: Start copying
 
In this window, you can see a summary of your settings and start copying your DVD. You can also change some advanced settings such as layer break flag removal or logging window by clicking on "Settings". Click on "Go" to start copying your DVD. You can see a progress bar and some statistics while transcoding and writing. You can also preview the movie during transcoding and writing by clicking on "Preview". When the copying process is finished, you will see a message saying "Operation successfully completed". Click on "OK" to exit.
