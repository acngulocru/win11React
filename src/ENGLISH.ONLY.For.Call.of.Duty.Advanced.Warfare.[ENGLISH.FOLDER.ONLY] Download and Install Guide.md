This will check and repair any missing or corrupted files.
- If the game has no sound or low volume, try to update your sound drivers. You can do this by going to your device manager, expanding the "Sound, video and game controllers" category, right-clicking on your sound device, and selecting "Update driver". Alternatively, you can download and install the latest drivers from your sound card manufacturer's website.
- If the game has poor performance or graphics quality, try to lower your settings. To do this, go to the options menu, select "Graphics", and adjust the sliders or checkboxes according to your preference. You can also use the "Optimal Settings" button to automatically set the best settings for your system.
