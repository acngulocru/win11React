If you are a fan of the classic horror game Silent Hill 2, you might have heard of the Silent Hill 2 Enhancements project, which is a mod that improves the graphics, audio, and gameplay of the original PC version. However, some users have reported an error when trying to launch the game, which says "The procedure entry point \_BinkSetSoundtrack@8 could not be located in the dynamic link library binkw32.dll".

This error is caused by a conflict between the binkw32.dll file that comes with the game and the one that is required by the mod. The binkw32.dll file is a component of the Bink Video codec, which is used by many games to play video files. The mod uses a newer version of the codec than the game, so it needs a different binkw32.dll file.
 
Fortunately, there is a simple solution to fix this error and enjoy the enhanced version of Silent Hill 2. All you need to do is to download the correct binkw32.dll file from a reliable source and replace the old one in your game folder. Here are the steps to do that:
 
1. Go to [this website](https://www.dll-files.com/binkw32.dll.html) and click on the "Download" button next to the file that matches your system type (32-bit or 64-bit).[^3^]
2. Save the file to your desktop or any other location where you can easily find it.
3. Navigate to your Silent Hill 2 game folder, which is usually located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Konami\Silent Hill 2 or C:\Program Files\Konami\Silent Hill 2.
4. Find and rename the existing binkw32.dll file to something else, such as binkw32\_old.dll. This way, you can restore it if something goes wrong.
5. Copy and paste the new binkw32.dll file that you downloaded into your game folder.
6. Launch the game and enjoy the enhancements without any errors.
