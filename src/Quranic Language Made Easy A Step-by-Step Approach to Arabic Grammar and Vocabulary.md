VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is a programming language that allows you to customize and automate ArcGIS Desktop applications. However, VBA is not included in the default installation of ArcGIS 10, and you need to run a separate setup and enable a license feature to use it. In this article, we will show you how to install and license VBA at ArcGIS 10 for both single use and concurrent use licenses.
  
## Installing VBA at ArcGIS 10
 
To install VBA at ArcGIS 10, you need to run the VBA setup that is available on the ArcGIS Desktop installation media. This setup installs both the VBA runtime (used in ArcGIS Desktop applications) and the VBA developer Help system. You can find the VBA setup in the \Desktop\Support\VBA folder of the installation media. Follow these steps to install VBA at ArcGIS 10:

2. Browse to the \Desktop\Support\VBA folder and double-click Setup.exe.
3. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation.
4. Restart your computer if prompted.

## Licensing VBA at ArcGIS 10
 
After installing VBA at ArcGIS 10, you need to enable the VBA license feature to use it as a developer or an end user. You cannot use the VBA developer environment or VBA code in existing documents without the VBA license feature. If you open a document that contains VBA code, and you do not have the feature fully installed, you will see a warning message like this:

The VBA code editor and integrated development environment (IDE) menu options only appear on the Customize dialog box if the VBA feature is properly installed and configured.
 
The process of licensing VBA at ArcGIS 10 depends on whether you have a single use or a concurrent use license. A single use license allows you to run ArcGIS Desktop on one machine only, while a concurrent use license allows you to run ArcGIS Desktop on multiple machines using a license manager. The following sections explain how to license VBA at ArcGIS 10 for each type of license.

### Licensing VBA at ArcGIS 10 with Single Use Licenses
 
Single use licenses have a license code similar to this: ESU123456789. To license VBA at ArcGIS 10 with single use licenses, you need to obtain an authorization number from Esri Customer Service and authorize it using the Software Authorization Wizard.

1. Contact Esri Customer Service by e-mail and request a free VBA extension authorization license. Wait for a reply.
2. Log on to the Customer Care Portal (CCP) and go to 'Authorizations'. You should see VBA in the list after the customer service representative has added it.
3. Click the VBA link, and you will see a new page with an authorization number. This number looks like ESU123456789. Note the number of licenses.
4. Run ArcGIS Administrator. Click Start > Programs > ArcGIS > ArcGIS Administrator.
5. In ArcGIS Administrator, click the Desktop node, and select a single use product, i.e., ArcInfo, ArcView, or ArcEditor. Click Authorize Now.
6. In the Software Authorization Wizard, select 'I have already authorized the software and need to authorize additional extensions.' Click Next.
7. Select 'Authorize with ESRI now using the Internet.' Click Next.
8. Fill out the required fields in the Authorization Information dialogs. Click Next.
9. In the Authorize Software Extensions dialog, under Options, select 'I have authorization number (s) to authorize one or more extensions.' and click Other Extensions.
10. In the Other Extensions dialog, double-click the empty field under Feature and type VBA.
