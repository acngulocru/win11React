If you are a fan of horror games, you might remember Night Trap, the controversial FMV game that was released in 1992 for the Sega CD. The game puts you in the role of a special agent who has to monitor and protect a group of teenage girls from a gang of vampires using hidden cameras and traps. The game was notorious for its violence and sexual content, and was one of the main targets of the congressional hearings on video game violence in 1993.
  
However, despite its controversy, Night Trap also has a cult following among gamers who appreciate its cheesy acting, campy humor, and nostalgic appeal. If you are one of them, you will be happy to know that Night Trap - 25th Anniversary Edition is now available for free download on Steam. This version of the game features remastered video quality, improved user interface, new scenes, and a documentary on the making of the game.
