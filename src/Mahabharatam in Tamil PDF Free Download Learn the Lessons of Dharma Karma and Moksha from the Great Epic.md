# Mahabharatam in Tamil: A Treasure of Ancient Wisdom and Epic Tales
 
Mahabharatam is one of the most revered and celebrated works of Hindu literature. It is an epic poem that narrates the story of the Kurukshetra War, a conflict between two branches of a royal family over the throne of Hastinapura. The Mahabharatam also contains many philosophical and spiritual teachings, such as the Bhagavad Gita, which is considered a sacred scripture by Hindus.
 
Many versions and translations of Mahabharatam exist in different languages, but the original Sanskrit text is attributed to Vyasa, a sage and poet who lived around the 4th century BCE. The Tamil version of Mahabharatam is believed to be a faithful rendition of Vyasa's work, done by various scholars and poets over several centuries. The Tamil Mahabharatam consists of 18 parvas or books, each containing several chapters and verses.
