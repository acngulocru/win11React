If you are a fan of tactical RPGs, you might have heard of Tear Ring Saga, a game developed by the creator of Fire Emblem series, Shouzou Kaga.

Tear Ring Saga is set in a medieval fantasy world where two rival kingdoms, Wellt and Zoa, are at war. The player can choose to follow the story of either Runan or Holmes, two young heroes who lead their own armies against the enemy forces. Along the way, they will encounter allies and enemies from different factions and races, such as dragons, pirates, and rebels. The game has 40 chapters in total, and each one has different objectives and conditions to complete.
 
One of the most appealing aspects of Tear Ring Saga is its gameplay mechanics. The game uses a grid-based map where the player can move their units and engage in battles with the enemy units. Each unit has its own stats, weapons, skills, and class. The game also features a permadeath system, where fallen units are gone for good unless the player restarts the chapter. The game also has a weapon triangle system, where swords beat axes, axes beat lances, and lances beat swords. Additionally, the game has a support system, where units can build relationships with each other and gain bonuses in combat.
 
Tear Ring Saga is a rare gem that deserves more attention from tactical RPG fans. Unfortunately, the game was never released outside Japan due to legal issues with Nintendo. However, thanks to the efforts of fan translators, the game is now playable in English. You can download the English patched ISO file from CDRomance.com[^1^] or Romspure.cc[^2^] and play it on an emulator or a modded console. If you are looking for a challenging and engaging tactical RPG with a rich story and characters, you should give Tear Ring Saga a try.

If you are interested in playing Tear Ring Saga, you might want to know some tips and tricks to make your experience more enjoyable. Here are some of the most useful ones:
 
- Save often. The game has multiple save slots and allows you to save at any point during a chapter. This is very helpful in case you make a mistake or want to try a different strategy.
- Pay attention to the weapon triangle. The game uses a similar system to Fire Emblem, where swords beat axes, axes beat lances, and lances beat swords. However, there are some exceptions, such as bows being effective against flying units and magic being effective against armored units.
- Use supports. The game has a support system where units can build relationships with each other by fighting together or talking in certain chapters. Supports can grant bonuses to hit rate, avoid rate, critical rate, and damage. You can check the support levels and bonuses in the status screen.
- Don't be afraid to promote early. The game has a unique promotion system where promoting before level 20 increases the level cap by 20 levels. For example, a level 10 promotion would have a cap of 30, a level 20 promotion would have a cap of 40, and so on. You can also use super proofs to unlock the level cap entirely. This means you can promote your units as soon as possible without losing any potential growth.
- Choose wisely. The game has two points where you have to choose one of four units to join your army. These choices are permanent and affect the availability of certain items and events. You can check the wiki for more information on these choices and their consequences.

These are some of the basic tips for playing Tear Ring Saga. If you want to learn more about the game, you can watch some gameplay videos on YouTube[^1^] [^2^] or read some guides on Reddit[^3^]. Have fun!
