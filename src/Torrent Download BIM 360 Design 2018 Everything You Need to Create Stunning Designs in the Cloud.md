If you want to try BIM 360 Design 2018 for free, you might be tempted to use torrents to download it. Torrents are a way of sharing files with other users over the internet. The files are compressed and encrypted, and split into pieces that are distributed among the users. To download a file using torrents, you need a torrent client software that can connect to other users and download the pieces of the file.
 
However, downloading BIM 360 Design 2018 using torrents is not recommended for several reasons. First of all, it is illegal and violates the terms of service of Autodesk.

You might download malware or viruses that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Third, it is unreliable and inefficient. You might not find a complete or working version of the software, or face slow download speeds and connection issues.

- \*\*Cloud-based worksharing\*\*: You can co-author Revit models with your team members in real time, without the need for costly and complex IT infrastructure. You can also access your models from any device, anywhere, anytime. This reduces errors, conflicts, and rework, and increases productivity and efficiency.
- \*\*Design collaboration\*\*: You can coordinate design deliverables across disciplines and stages, and track changes and feedback using version control and markups. You can also create packages of models and documents for review and approval, and monitor the status of deliverables using dashboards and reports. This enhances communication, transparency, and accountability among project stakeholders.
- \*\*Data management\*\*: You can store, organize, and manage your project data in a secure cloud repository, with granular access controls and permissions. You can also link your data to other Autodesk Construction Cloud products, such as BIM 360 Docs, BIM 360 Build, BIM 360 Coordinate, and BIM 360 Ops. This ensures data consistency, quality, and compliance throughout the project lifecycle.
- \*\*Clash analysis\*\*: You can perform automated clash detection and resolution on your models using BIM 360 Coordinate, which is included in BIM Collaborate Pro. You can also create issues and assign them to responsible parties for resolution. This helps you identify and fix design errors before they become costly problems in the field.
- \*\*Project insights\*\*: You can gain insights into your project performance using BIM 360 Insight, which is also included in BIM Collaborate Pro. You can analyze data from various sources, such as models, documents, issues, RFIs, submittals, etc., and generate reports and dashboards that help you make informed decisions. You can also leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify risks and opportunities for improvement.
- \*\*Design-to-construction connection\*\*: You can connect your design data to the construction phase using BIM 360 Build, which is another product in the Autodesk Construction Cloud portfolio. You can use your models to create 2D or 3D work packages for field execution, track progress and quality using checklists and inspections, and capture field data using mobile devices. This helps you bridge the gap between design intent and construction reality.
- \*\*Scalability and flexibility\*\*: You can scale up or down your BIM 360 Design subscription according to your project needs and budget. You can also choose between two cloud platforms: BIM 360 or Autodesk Construction Cloud. Both platforms offer similar features and functions, but differ in terms of user interface, administration tools, integrations, etc. You can use either platform or both for your projects.

As you can see, BIM 360 Design is a powerful solution that can help you streamline your design collaboration and data management processes, improve your design quality and coordination, and optimize your project outcomes.
