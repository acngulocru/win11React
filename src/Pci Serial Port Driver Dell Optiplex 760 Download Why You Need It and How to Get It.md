## Why are these drivers missing?
 
These drivers may be missing because they are not compatible with newer versions of Windows, such as Windows 8.1 or Windows 10. Dell does not provide official drivers for these versions of Windows for the Optiplex 760 model. However, you can still use generic drivers from Intel or older drivers from Dell that work fine with Vista.
 
## How to download and install these drivers?
 
There are two ways to download and install these drivers: manually or automatically. We recommend using the automatic method, as it is easier and safer.
 
### Automatic method
 
The automatic method involves using a tool called Dell Command Update, which scans your computer for missing or outdated drivers and downloads and installs them for you. You can download Dell Command Update from [here](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/optiplex-760/drivers). After downloading, run the file and follow the instructions on the screen. The tool will detect your device model and operating system and find the best drivers for you. You may need to restart your computer after the installation is complete.
 
### Manual method
 
The manual method involves finding and downloading the drivers yourself from the internet and installing them manually. You can use the following steps:
