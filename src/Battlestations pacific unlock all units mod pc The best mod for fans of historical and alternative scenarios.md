Battlestations Pacific is a naval and air combat simulation game that lets you play as either the United States or Japan in the Pacific theater of World War II. The game features a variety of units, such as ships, planes, submarines, and even rockets, that you can use in different modes and missions. However, not all units are available from the start. Some units require you to complete certain campaigns or reach certain ranks in multiplayer to unlock them.
 
If you want to unlock all units without having to play through the campaigns or multiplayer, you can use mods that modify the game files and remove the unlock requirements. Mods are user-made modifications that change some aspects of the game, such as graphics, gameplay, or content. There are several mods available for Battlestations Pacific that can help you unlock all units, but you need to be careful when installing them, as they may cause compatibility issues or errors.

One of the most popular and comprehensive mods for Battlestations Pacific is **BSmodHQ Update v.4.0 for BSP**, which enhances the graphics, sound, gameplay, and content of the game. It also includes two new mission packs, **Long Odds Mission Pack** and **Empire's Strike Mission Pack**, which add 22 new missions for both US and Japanese campaigns. You can download this mod from [Steam Community](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1480894940)[^1^]. To install it, you need to have the latest version of the game (v1.2) and follow the instructions in the installer.
 
To unlock all units with this mod, you need to edit a file called `Vehicleclasses.lua`, which is located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Battlestations Pacific\GameData\Scripts\Game`. You can use a text editor like Notepad++ to open this file. In this file, you will see a list of all units in the game, each with a set of parameters. Under each unit that you want to unlock, you need to delete a line that says `Unlockid = ...`. This line determines which campaign or rank is required to unlock the unit. By deleting it, you make the unit available as an unlock in the game. Make sure to backup this file before making any changes.
 
Here is an example of how to unlock the Kikka jet fighter for Japan, which normally requires reaching Fleet Admiral rank in multiplayer:

    -- Kikka
    
        Name = "Kikka",
        Class = CLASS_PLANE_FIGHTER,
        Model = "kikka",
        Icon = "icon_plane_fighter",
        Description = "description_kikka",
        Unlockid = UNLOCKID_JAPAN_FLEET_ADMIRAL,
        Cost = 1000,
        Hitpoints = 1000,
        Maxspeed = 100,
        ...

You need to delete the line `Unlockid = UNLOCKID_JAPAN_FLEET_ADMIRAL,` and save the file. Then you can launch the game and select the Kikka as an unlock in the unit selection screen.
 
You can repeat this process for any unit that you want to unlock. However, be aware that some units may not work properly or cause errors in some modes or missions. For example, some units are only designed for specific missions or scenarios, and using them elsewhere may cause glitches or crashes. Also, some units may not be balanced or realistic compared to others, and using them may affect the difficulty or fun of the game.
